Leader [[High Druid Sylvarion]] 

Population: Lizardfolk, tabaxi, and humans coexist, with an emphasis on tribal councils.

Key Features: Serpentia is a city hidden within the jungle, featuring treehouse-like dwellings. It's known for its herbalism and animal companionship. Tribal leaders govern each district, but they occasionally gather to make important decisions.

  

The Reptilian Council: Serpentia's leadership consists of wise lizardfolk councilors who make decisions based on guidance from jungle spirits. Characters may be asked to assist the council in maintaining the balance of the jungle.

  

The Poisoned Pools: Hidden within the jungle are mystical pools with healing or transformative properties. Characters could seek these pools for their benefits or be tasked with protecting them from those who seek to exploit them.

  

The Misty Veil: A dense mist surrounds the city, providing natural camouflage. The jungle is filled with traps and illusions created by the Tabaxi guardians to deter intruders. Characters must navigate this challenging environment.
