a magic weapon passed down from past lives of [[Illusia]] it converts life force into explosive power and doesn't require bullets to fire.

The user uses their life force to cause damage to enemy infront of them, based on percentage. So if they have 10hp, and use 5hp to charge Glock. then it will do 50% of hp damage to enemy. This can be charged up to 100%. 

Possibly in the future it can be put into overcharge if several people/creatures dedicate their life force for the cause of using it.
