**Backstory of the Arcane Soul Harvester:**

Centuries ago, a brilliant and ambitious wizard named Arion Radiance was renowned for his mastery of arcane arts. Arion's insatiable thirst for knowledge and power, however, led him to delve into forbidden realms of magic. Despite warnings from colleagues and mentors, Arion became obsessed with finding a way to overcome the limitations of mortal life.

In his pursuit of immortality, Arion conducted dark experiments, ultimately leading him to the forbidden path of lichdom. The transformation into undeath granted Arion the longevity he sought, but it failed to quench his desire for true, eternal life. Consumed by the fear of fading into obscurity, Arion embarked on an even darker path.

In his twisted research, Arion discovered ancient texts describing a forbidden ritual known as the "Arcane Soul Harvest." This dark ritual, purportedly granting unparalleled power and eternal life, involved extracting the life forces of extraordinary entities across the realms. Convinced that this was the key to achieving true immortality, Arion embraced the forbidden knowledge and embraced his new identity as the Arcane Soul Harvester.

Arion gathered a following of like-minded individuals, forming the Penumbral Essence Cult. Together, they hunted legendary dragons, ancient fey, and renowned wizards, extracting their life forces to fuel Arion's insatiable hunger for power. The cult operated in shadows, leaving behind a trail of weakened or lifeless husks.

However, the process took a toll on Arion. Each stolen essence left a lingering imprint of the victim's memories and emotions, causing Arion to grapple with the echoes of countless lives. Beneath the mask of intellectual arrogance and manipulative charm lies a tortured soul, haunted by the consequences of his relentless pursuit.

As the Penumbral Essence Cult's activities escalate, the very fabric of the realms begins to unravel. The weakening barriers between planes and the accelerated pace of the harvest draw the attention of adventurers, setting the stage for a climactic confrontation with the tragic figure at the center of it allâ€”Arion Radiance, the Arcane Soul Harvester.

**Arcane Soul Harvesting Process:**

1. **Identification of Targets:** The lich identifies exceptionally powerful entities across the realms whose life forces, once harvested, would grant unparalleled power and longevity. These entities could include celestial beings, ancient dragons, fey creatures, and other extraordinary beings.
    
2. **Minion Network:** The Arcane Soul Harvester employs a network of minions and cultists to locate and capture these powerful entities. These minions use magical devices created by the lich to extract and store the life force, leaving the victims weakened or lifeless husks.
    
3. **Storage and Absorption:** The harvested life forces are stored in arcane containers, each carefully labeled and enchanted to preserve the essence within. The Arcane Soul Harvester absorbs these stored life forces to sustain its own existence and enhance its magical abilities.
    
4. **Amplification Rituals:** The lich periodically performs dark rituals to amplify and harness the harvested life forces. These rituals not only provide the lich with increased power but also contribute to the destabilization of the fabric of reality.
    
5. **Phylactery Empowerment:** The absorbed life forces are also used to empower the lich's phylactery, making it more resilient and reinforcing the connection between the lich's soul and its undead form. This ensures the lich's continued existence and ability to reform even if destroyed.
    

**Appearance of the Arcane Soul Harvester:**

The Arcane Soul Harvester, known as Arion, appears as a once-human figure transformed into a gaunt and spectral form by the dark rituals of lichdom. Its physical appearance is twisted and corrupted, with skeletal features and glowing, malevolent eyes that burn with an otherworldly flame.

1. **Enshrouded Robes:** Arion is draped in tattered and enshrouded robes that seem to absorb and reflect ambient magical energy. These robes conceal much of its skeletal form, giving it an ominous and mysterious presence.
    
2. **Glowing Runic Patterns:** Faint, pulsating runic patterns cover Arion's exposed bones and parts of its robes. These runes are a manifestation of the lich's mastery over dark magic and serve as conduits for the absorption and manipulation of life forces.
    
3. **Ethereal Tendrils:** Wisps of ethereal energy extend from Arion's outstretched hands, especially when it engages in arcane rituals or attempts to drain the life force of its victims. These tendrils are the conduits through which the lich absorbs the stolen essence.
    
4. **Crown of Eldritch Power:** Arion wears a crown or circlet adorned with gems and dark crystals, symbolizing its mastery over the stolen life forces. The crown enhances the lich's magical abilities and serves as a focal point for the amplification rituals.
    
5. **Malevolent Aura:** An oppressive and malevolent aura surrounds Arion, causing unease and fear in those who approach. The air around the lich seems to shimmer with dark energy, and the temperature drops whenever it manifests.
    

Overall, the Arcane Soul Harvester, Arion, is a formidable and ominous figure, driven by a relentless pursuit of power and immortality through the dark arts of soul harvesting. Its appearance reflects the corruption of its once-human form and the unnatural fusion of undeath and dark magic.
