[[The Mountain Citadel of Ironhelm]] 

Description: The Ironforge Tavern in Ironhelm is a hearty, stone-built establishment adorned with ornate metalwork and glowing gemstones. Dwarven smithing tools double as decor, and the bar counter is a polished slab of granite. The tavern serves hearty dwarven cuisine and ales brewed in the city's depths. The innkeeper, Orik Stonebeard, is a jovial dwarf with a booming voice and a penchant for storytelling.
