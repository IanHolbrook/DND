[[The Enchanted Forest of Sylvanoria]] 

The Enchanted Grove is nestled within the ancient trees of Sylvanoria. The inn is built around the massive trunk of an age-old tree, with bioluminescent plants illuminating the interior. The bar is made of intertwined vines, and the rooms are decorated with leaves, flowers, and carved wooden furnishings. The innkeeper, [[Elaria]] a, is a gentle elf who practices herbalism and offers guests potions brewed from forest herbs.
