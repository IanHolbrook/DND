Use [[Glock]] to defeat big bad by everyone sacrificing their life force to kill it

Big bad is some kind of lich, so it has multiple health bars?

Have the big bad, find out that one of the main characters can reincarnate. Since he is tormented by the souls of the lives that he has stolen, a entity that has an immortal soul and constantly changes bodys intrigues him.

Use that to make the big bad envious and want to steal the ability of reincarnation.

Might end in the party using the glock to sacrifice the ability of reincarnation to release all the souls the big bad has absorbed
