**Background:** Centuries ago, a powerful and ambitious wizard sought immortality through forbidden rituals. Consumed by an insatiable desire for eternal life, the wizard delved into dark arts and necromancy, eventually transforming into a lich. However, the lich's thirst for immortality persisted, driving them to a more sinister solution – the arcane harvesting of life forces.

**Motivation:** The lich believes that by absorbing the life forces of exceptionally powerful beings, they can achieve true immortality and transcend the limitations of undeath. The lich has identified a series of rare and extraordinary entities across the realms whose life forces, once harvested, would grant them unparalleled power and longevity.

**Modus Operandi:** The Arcane Soul Harvester employs a network of minions and cultists to locate and capture these entities. The minions use magical devices created by the lich to extract and store the life force, leaving the victims weakened or lifeless husks. The lich then absorbs these stored life forces to sustain their own existence and enhance their magical abilities.

Cult Name: Penumbral Essence   

This personality type creates a complex and intriguing character for the players to interact with. It can lead to moments of negotiation, philosophical discussions, and potentially even opportunities for redemption or sympathy if the players delve into the lich's tragic past.
